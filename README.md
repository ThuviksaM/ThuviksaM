### Hi there 👋

I'm Thuviksa, I am a HUGE fan of GitHub and I LOVE to code (especialy in Python). 🐍
I'm a major participater in ORCSGirls (https://www.orcsgirls.org) classes, they are SUPER fun, in fact, if you are a 5th - 8th grader I highly recommend participating in some! They were even awarded with one of the first Top-Rated Awards of 2021 from GreatNonprofits! 🥇 Genarally, they're AMAZING! 😎
