<h1>Hey, this is Thuviksa!</h1>

According to me I'm just a general Middle Schooler 😉, except that I'm also on GitHub :octocat: :electron:

You can find me on Scratch with the username [@iona689](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/iona689/)


I am a huge fan of Git and GitHub, and I love to code (especialy in Python). 🐍 
[Dr. Proffen](https://github.com/tproffen), [Amelie Nagle](https://github.com/SootSprite15), and many others are my major roll-models. 
I, also love collecting and analyzing data, because the results are always amazingly unpredictable, suprising, and awesome. 📊 
And I love all Octocats! :octocat:

Oh! And, before I forget, I love💕 nature! 🌎

I'm a major participant and volunteer in [ORCSGirls events](https://www.orcsgirls.org/events), they are SUPER fun, in fact, if you are a 5th - 8th grade girl or have a daughter who is, I highly recommend registering for some! 
They were even awarded with one of the Top-Rated Awards of 2021 from [GreatNonprofits](https://greatnonprofits.org/org/oak-ridge-computer-science-girls)! 🥇 
Genarally, they're AMAZING! 😎 
You can visit them on GitHub at [@orcsgirls](https://github.com/orcsgirls). :basecamp:
