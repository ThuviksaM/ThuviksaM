# Hey there 👋, I'm Thuviksa Mathialakan! 
<!-- ### [:octocat::electron:](https://github.com/ThuviksaM/Berry_Blob) -->

I am a _huge_ fan of Git and GitHub, and I _love_ to code (especialy in Python). 🐍 Dr. Proffen, Amelie Nagle, and many others are my major roll-models. I, also _love_ collecting and analyzing data, because the results are always amazingly unpredictable, suprising, and awesome. 📊 And I _love_ all Octocats! :octocat:

I'm a major participater in ORCSGirls (https://www.orcsgirls.org) classes, they are SUPER fun, in fact, if you are a 5th - 8th grade girl or have a daughter who is, I highly recommend registering for some! They were even awarded with one of the first Top-Rated Awards of 2021 from GreatNonprofits (https://greatnonprofits.org/org/oak-ridge-computer-science-girls)! 🥇 Genarally, they're AMAZING! 😎

Here are a few facts about my Git and GitHub life :octocat: :electron::

- 🖱️ I'm currently working on a lot of environment monitoring and other scientific code for my Raspberry Pi
- 📚 I'm currently learning a lot about Git and GitHub using [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) (P.S. - It's really helpful)
