### Hey there 👋!

I'm Thuviksa, I am a HUGE fan of Git and GitHub, and I LOVE to code (especialy in Python). 🐍
I'm a major participater in ORCSGirls (https://www.orcsgirls.org) classes, they are SUPER fun, in fact, if you are a 5th - 8th grade girl or have a daughter who is, I highly recommend registering for some! They were even awarded with one of the first Top-Rated Awards of 2021 from GreatNonprofits (https://greatnonprofits.org/org/oak-ridge-computer-science-girls)! 🥇 Genarally, they're AMAZING! 😎

Here are a few facts about my Git life :octocat: :electron::
